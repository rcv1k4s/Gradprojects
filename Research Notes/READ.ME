readtracelog.sh can be used to convert trace output from compilation to be converted to fucntion call graph stating entry and exit of functions.
compile any .c file and get .o(compile with -finstruments -fucntions flags) and link .o file on program to be profiles and trace.o (obtained by compiling trace.c in the same folder)
then cat trace.out 
then run ./readtracelog.sh trace.out to get the log file containing function call graph
