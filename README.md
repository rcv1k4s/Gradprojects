Research under TECSAR group I am doing : https://coefs.uncc.edu/htabkhiv/
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/1D-CNN contains my imagenet convolution model modified from squeezenet to extract 1D feature maps instead of 2D feature maps

/2D Convolution Contains code developed for work loading purposes to test GPU's

/Research Notes/ Contains notes of problems or errors I faced and solution for them 

/Seperableconvolution/ Contains  transition of caffe weights in to seperable and gaussian

/pseudo-maxwell/ contains psuedo maxwell architecture designed to behave near to Jetson TX1 for GPGPU-sim.

/Research/Opencvfunction_calgrind contains opencv cpp samples callgrind profile outputs

/tf-imagenet contains python script to make tensor flow imagenet TF record for imagenet model Import 

Note: Research I am about to publish is not posted in github, I will update once I have published.
