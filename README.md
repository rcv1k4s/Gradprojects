Research under TECSAR group I am doing

/1D-CNN contains my imagenet convolution model modified from squeezenet to extract 1D feature maps instead of 2D feature maps

/2D Convolution Contains code developed for work loading purposes to test GPU's

/Research Notes/ Contains wall i got hit while developing them 

/Seperableconvolution/ Contains  transition of caffe weights in to seperable and gaussian

/pseudo-maxwell/ contains psuedo maxwell architecture designed to something near to Jetson TX1
