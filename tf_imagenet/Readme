To build Imagenet TF records for training using imagenet dataset
----------------------------------------------------------------
processes images as labels in imagenet dataset as TF records usable as module to run in tensorflow by importing them

place this script in place of models/research/slim/datasets folder and run it 
\
python build_imagenet_data.py
-----------------------------

give data_dir directory in which you have imagenet/train/ dataset labelled folders like n0722323

Once you have the data in /tmp/ as TFrecords 

you can import them using:

filenames = ["/var/data/file1.tfrecord", "/var/data/file2.tfrecord"]
dataset = tf.data.TFRecordDataset(filenames)

once you import data in TFrecords you can toy with data with ease using tf.data functions!1
