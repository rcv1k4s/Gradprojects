Version 2.0:
Implementting a 1D filter instead of 2D for CNN i.e Implementing a Network that can learn 1D Patterns and Identify for Image Classification.
Replaced 7X7 with two parallel 7X1 and 1X7 Convolution and pooled in cross dimensional filter such that data can be concatanated.
Worked!!!!!!!!!!!! loss Converging.

****967117sn****	contains Arhcitecture copyable to train_val.prototxt and run in caffe.

***Training Time is High and Just a modified version of Squeezenet. Hence scaling 1D filter in to Squeezemodules o Squeeze Inception Module.
