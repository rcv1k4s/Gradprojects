Version 1.0:

Tried replacing 7X7 with two series 7X1 and 1X7 Convolutions and then Relu pooled.

Didnt Work network Loss Didnt converge. Tried with various sets of Training Hyper Parameters.

Reason: Network is not learning patterns in 1D Hence Loss was not converging.


Version 1.1:
Thought series convolution of 7X1 and 1X7 is not finding dimensional patterns properly hence I put 2 Parallel 48 7X1,1X7 and 1X7, 7X1

Still Loss didn't Converge

48sn contains architecture copyable in to train_val.prototxt and usable with caffe.

Lesson Learnt: Network Learns only if it is Learns.

Then Moved to Version 2.0.
